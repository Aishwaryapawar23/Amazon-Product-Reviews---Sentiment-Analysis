<H1> Problem statement</H1>

Reviews tell what products and features are trending, what is in demand, what is no longer relevant, how products and those of competitors are doing, and much more.
It is observed that the maximum number of customers look at product reviews before they make a purchase. Survey results show that positive product reviews are a key factor for purchasing by 57 percent of Amazon buyers (Statista, 2019).

As product reviews are often the deciding factor for many customers, it’s very important to have a well-automated system for monitoring them.
The traditional manual process of Amazon product reviews is time-consuming and inefficient when millions of reviews are being posted all the time. It doesn’t show any trend or patterns over time. Moreover, it is tough to understand customers’ sentiment towards any product or its delivery.
